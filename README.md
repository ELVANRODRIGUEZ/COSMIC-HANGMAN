On this project a "Hangman" game will be created. The topic
will be "Words of Outer Sapace". It will ask the user to
guess words related to concepts of the cosmos.
It will start at any key pressed and the instructions will be
at reach for the user to figure out how to play. 
I will be developing this excercise for a school project 
over the next week.
